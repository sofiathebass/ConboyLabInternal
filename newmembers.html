            <h2>Locations</h2>
            <h3>Where are the chemicals?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li style="font-weight:100; margin-bottom:10px;">Overall list of what we have as of the last inventory check is on the door of the non-hazardous chemicals, also in the inventory lists tab</li>
                <li>Dry non-hazardous</li>
                <p style="font-weight:100; margin-bottom:10px;">Dry non-hazardous chemicals shared by the lab will be in the cabinets next to the lab coats. These are generally used to make different buffers, washing, blocking, etc. They're sorted alphabetically, and should be on the chemical inventory list on the door of the cabinets.</p>
                <li>Flammable</li>
                <p style="font-weight:100; margin-bottom:10px;">Flammable chemicals will be in grey cabinets under the biosafety hoods in the lab. There's one directly under the hood with the cloroform that has most of the flammable substances, and another directly under the hood with the ethanol that has the ethanol, methanol, and a few other larger flammable bottles. </p>
                <li>Strong Acids</li>
                <p style="font-weight:100; margin-bottom:10px;">Strong acids are in the grey cabinet next to the flammable cabinet under the biosafety hood with the chloroform.</p>
                <li>Strong Bases</li>
                <p style="font-weight:100; margin-bottom:10px;">Strong bases are in the grey cabinet next to the flammable cabinet under the biosafety hood with the ethanol.</p>
                <li>4C Degree</li>
                <p style="font-weight:100; margin-bottom:10px;">The main space to store lab use chemicals/antibodies at 4C is the fridge room. Walking out from the lab, go to the corridor on the left and it's the fridge looking door. Turn the red light switch to turn on the lights. The lab itself has several personal fridges at the benches, don't look in those without permission. For cell culture only, there's another fridge in the cell culture room that houses media and supplements.</p>
                <li>-20C Degree</li>
                <p style="font-weight:100; margin-bottom:10px;">There are three -20 freezers that are used. One is in the room next to the cell culture room that has some antibody atock, all of our hybridomas, aliquoted cell culture media additives (ex. pen/strep and bgs), and western blot ice blocks and ladders. Unless otherwise labelled, this freezer is for general lab use and you're welcome to use what's in here. The second freezer is in the -80 freezer room across from the lab. This is where lots of media additive are for specific cell types, ex. B27 for NPCs that individual lab members restock and use for their personal projects. Ask before using these additives. There are also some racks of personal use things from different mentors and past lab members. The third -20 is across from the microscope room, and it has more racks for personal use that are labelled, as well as back stock of different animal serum and kits such as different Antibody Array kits.</p>
                <li>-80C Degree</li>
                <p style="font-weight:100; margin-bottom:10px;">There are two -80 degree freezers, both in the same freezer room directly across from lab. One is upright and one is a chest freezer and they hold all the long term freeze samples and aliquots of some common reagents. <br><br> For bFGF (cell culture growth factor) and Matrigel/ECM there is a rack in the center and middle of the chest freezer labelled bFGF with a pink tag.</p>
            </ul>
            <h3>Where are my cell culture materials?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Media</li>
                <p style="font-weight:100; margin-bottom:10px;">In the fridge in the cell culture room. More media can be found in the 4C fridge room on the right side under the desk. Some of this is for general lab use and some is ordered for specific projects, so ask the relevant person before using any bottles of media.</p>
                <li>Additives</li>
                <p style="font-weight:100; margin-bottom:10px;">On the third shelf down in the fridge in the cell culture room is anything that's usable for general lab use (excepting things labelled with initials of lab members) including antibiotics and some media additives. Aliquot replacements for these additives can be found in the different chest freezers, see the "where are my chemicals" section. </p>
                <li>Plates/Flasks</li>
                <p style="font-weight:100; margin-bottom:10px;">In the cell culture room and the room next to it are the cell culture flasks and plates.</p>
                <li>Ethanol/Serological Pipettes</li>
                <p style="font-weight:100; margin-bottom:10px;">Look at the Cell Culture Standard Practices section</p>
            </ul>
            <h3>Who do I ask?</h3>
            <p>For mouse work the go to people are Cammeron and Joanna. For cell culture Zach and Alexandra. For Antibody Arrays Rana and Joanna. For sectioning of brains and hearts Joanna again. Good luck!</p>

                <li>Make an appointment to be fitted for your PPE, link is on the ehs page</li>
                <li>Get fitted and get your lab coat, goggles, and glasses!</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Ethanol, stockroom, and standard practices</h2>
            <h3>Cell Culture Standard Practices</h3>
            <p>If you are doing cell culture, you must learn how to restock everything!!! Don't leave ethanol bottles empty, the pipette container empty, the hood dirty, and clean up after yourself!</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Ethanol Restocking</b></li>
                <li><b>Pipette Restocking</b></li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Ethanol Restocking:</b> There are bottles of 70% ethanol that you will use in the hood to sterilize your lab space. If these are 50% or under, please refill them!!! Right outside of the TC room there's a chemical hood with an ethanol bottle labelled 70% ethanol, refill the bottles with that! If that bottle is empty or close to empty, make more 70% ethanol and refill that bottle as well. For this, use the 190 proof ethanol bottles, add 70% that and 30% DI water from the spout over the sink right next to the TC room. Usually this ends up being 700mL 190 proof ethanol, 300mL water and we have graduated cylinders around for measuring. If the 190 proof ethanol runs out look in the flammable cabinet under the hood and grab a new bottle. If there are no other bottles add it to the stock room sheet on the door. If we run out of ethanol, especially on the weekends, we can't do cell culture!</p>
            <p><b>Pipette Restocking:</b> You'll find serological and aspirating pipettes super nicely and easily available in the TC room, make sure they're available for others when you're done with the hood! First, look in the pullout cabinet right behind the hoods, the lowest shelf under the bead bath. From this backstock, nicely refill the container with 2mL aspirating pipettes in the far left, 5mL and 10mL serological pipettes in the center, and 25mL and 50mL serological pipettes in the far right section of the container. If this backstock runs out of any of the pipettes, check our lab's stock room. The location of our lab's stock room is the microscope room, one room down from the walk in fridge on the same side of the hallway. Check the locations section of this guide for a more in depth location if you don't know where the walk in fridge is. If you can't find any backstock in our stockroom, write it on the stockroom sheet the same way as you would the ethanol. Again these are super important and we cannot do without them and still do cell culture, so make sure to help out the others!</p>
            <h3>Microscope Standard Practices</h3>
            <p>The microscope room is next to the fridge room at the far end of the hallway. To get trained on either of the microscopes for immunofluorescence or another protocol, please refer to a grad student or senior undergrad who's used it before, as these are fairly expensive instruments and hard to replace. A few things to especially note here for reference if you forgot to write it down is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li style="font-weight:100; margin-bottom:10px;">Making it Work: Attach camera -> Turn on fluorescence box -> Turn on microscope -> Turn on computer -> Navigate to the imaging software </li>
                <li style="font-weight:100; margin-bottom:10px;">Fluorescence: Don't leave the fluorescence box on!!! Don't do it! You'll burn out the light and that's super expensive to replace. Also, for health of the lamp, please keep it on for 20 minutes before you turn it back off, and for health of your fluorescent cells, if you spend too long focusing you'll bleach the fluorescence of the spot on your cells and it won't image clearly. </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Mouse House Standard Practices</h3>
            <p>I won't touch too much on the mouse house, as you should get extensively trained before gaining independent access, but I'll briefly touch on the process of getting access. First, find a project and grad student/postdoc to work with. Second, bake me brownies. Third, once your mentor has given permission, email Mike to get on the AUP. This basically just says you're allowed to work with the mice. To get actual key card access to the mouse house, there's a sheet on the OLAC website that outlines the necessary steps. This includes signing up for an orientation of the mouse house, which is just a walkthrough of all the facilities. You'll also have to complete the required trainings and health forms. Lastly, I would heavily encourage getting euthanasia training (and it may soon be required), because it will be the cornerstone of any procedures you further do in lab and will allow you to eventually work independently of your mentor. The training is fairly short, but packed full of information and they'll help you learn to work with animals and fill in any gaps your mentor might have missed in your training as the people you train with have worked with mice as their career and are up to date on all the newest and most ethical practices. Plus, for the next month, I fully convinced several people I was human euthanasia trained.</p>
            <h2>The Good Scientist Guide</h2>
            <h3>Gloves</h3>
            <p>General Rules about gloves:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>One Glove Policy </li>
                <li>No Gloves in the Breakroom</li>
                <li>Reusing Gloves</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>One Glove Policy: </b>The one glove policy basically means that you shouldn't be touching doorknobs with gloves. When you're going out of lab to grab something, you can have one glove on to hold your things, but at least one hand must be ungloved for doors, even if you didn't touch anything super deadly! Say I used gloves to handle, idk, nuclear waste, and touched a completely inert PBS bottle. I put the PBS bottle back, and then you come along and just grab the PBS to use, then put it back and go touch an elevator button. Now this elevator button has nuclear waste, and you didn't even realize it! Even if you didn't touch anything at all with the glove, it's a good habit to always use the one glove policy.</p>
            <p><b>No Gloves in the Breakroom: </b>No gloves in the breakroom or on the breakroom door! We eat in the breakroom so this is hard rule. Not even one, not just to grab something really quickly, definitely not in the break room trash can.</p>
            <p><b>Reusing Gloves: </b>General practice is to not reuse gloves that have become wet, they're also like the least expensive things in lab so if in doubt change them out!</p>
            <h3>Labelling</h3>
            <p><b>Label every tube and lid with initials, date, and what it is/what's in it!</b> If you don't people won't use it, and you'll forget about it, and it'll end up being extra clutter around the lab. Also, you might mix it up with other tubes or get lids mixed up, but that's something you'll figure out the first time you forget or cut corners (I sure learned my lesson!)</p>
            <h3>Restocking</h3>
            <p><b>Restock when you notice something is half full</b>, and if you're on the last bag of backstock refill the backstock, replace the backstock by ordering more, or add it to the order sheet on the front door to the lab.</p>
            <p>Restocking when something is half full is important because oftentimes protocols are time dependent, to give time to replace the backstock if empty, and because it's courteous to other scientists.</p>
            <ul>
                <li style="font-weight:100; margin-bottom:10px;">Protocols are time dependent: Whether dependent on the protocol or because you're trying to get to your next class or meeting, timing can be critical to an experiment. If you refill when something is half full, you're in control of when you can refill it, versus if you wait until something is completely out, you might ruin an incubation step or be late to a meeting, even though you planned it meticulously before. Especially if you're sharing with others, ex. in the cell culture room, while your work might not be as time critical, theirs might be and after using all the stock, they might go for it and realize it's empty.</li>
                <li style="font-weight:100; margin-bottom:10px;">Allow for time to replace the backstock: You've waited until the last second to replace the serological pipettes in the TC room, but you know you have a 5 minute incubation coming up. This is plenty of time to get more from the cabinet right behind you. Unfortunately, as you open up the cabinet, there aren't any more pipettes! Fortunately, you know there's more stock in the microscope room. Unfortunately, however, that's out as well. Even worse, the stock room in Stanley Hall just closed. You don't find any pipettes, your cells die, and you very unfortunately have to restart a 6 month process. While in a perfect world everyone always orders more when they realize there's no backstock, sometimes people don't notice things running out or there were delays in getting more of what's needed. Therefore, prompt ordering when you notice things running out, and replacing things early to account for and notice issues such as this in time is important!</li>
                <li style="font-weight:100; margin-bottom:10px;">Courtesy to other scientists: These issues also happen if you leave something you've used empty. While your work might've been done, they might have to spend 30 minutes resetting everything you've used up, which can be annoying or catastrophic to their timing/project. Be courteous and don't get that reputation as an uncourteous scientist in lab!</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Lab Notebooks</h3>
            <p>Lab notebooks are in the giant pile of lab notebooks! Label yours with your name and keep a great record of everything you do/where things are located. The purpose of lab notebooks is to keep a log for going back and understanding what you did in past experiments, both to redo them and write about it later, or if you somehow end up in a patent dispute these logs can be used to figure out who discovered something first! Get in good habits now to help out later!</p>
            <p>Stay safe out there!!!</p>
