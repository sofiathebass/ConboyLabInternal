            <h3>Cell Culture Standard Practices</h3>
            <p>If you are doing cell culture, you must learn how to restock everything!!! Don't leave ethanol bottles empty, the pipette container empty, the hood dirty, and clean up after yourself!</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Ethanol Restocking</b></li>
                <li><b>Pipette Restocking</b></li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Ethanol Restocking:</b> There are bottles of 70% ethanol that you will use in the hood to sterilize your lab space. If these are 50% or under, please refill them!!! Right outside of the TC room there's a chemical hood with an ethanol bottle labelled 70% ethanol, refill the bottles with that! If that bottle is empty or close to empty, make more 70% ethanol and refill that bottle as well. For this, use the 190 proof ethanol bottles, add 70% that and 30% DI water from the spout over the sink right next to the TC room. Usually this ends up being 700mL 190 proof ethanol, 300mL water and we have graduated cylinders around for measuring. If the 190 proof ethanol runs out look in the flammable cabinet under the hood and grab a new bottle. If there are no other bottles add it to the stock room sheet on the door. If we run out of ethanol, especially on the weekends, we can't do cell culture!</p>
            <p><b>Pipette Restocking:</b> You'll find serological and aspirating pipettes super nicely and easily available in the TC room, make sure they're available for others when you're done with the hood! First, look in the pullout cabinet right behind the hoods, the lowest shelf under the bead bath. From this backstock, nicely refill the container with 2mL aspirating pipettes in the far left, 5mL and 10mL serological pipettes in the center, and 25mL and 50mL serological pipettes in the far right section of the container. If this backstock runs out of any of the pipettes, check our lab's stock room. The location of our lab's stock room is the microscope room, one room down from the walk in fridge on the same side of the hallway. Check the locations section of this guide for a more in depth location if you don't know where the walk in fridge is. If you can't find any backstock in our stockroom, write it on the stockroom sheet the same way as you would the ethanol. Again these are super important and we cannot do without them and still do cell culture, so make sure to help out the others!</p>

            <h3>Gloves</h3>
            <p>General Rules about gloves:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>One Glove Policy </li>
                <li>No Gloves in the Breakroom</li>
                <li>Reusing Gloves</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>One Glove Policy: </b>The one glove policy basically means that you shouldn't be touching doorknobs with gloves. When you're going out of lab to grab something, you can have one glove on to hold your things, but at least one hand must be ungloved for doors, even if you didn't touch anything super deadly! Say I used gloves to handle, idk, nuclear waste, and touched a completely inert PBS bottle. I put the PBS bottle back, and then you come along and just grab the PBS to use, then put it back and go touch an elevator button. Now this elevator button has nuclear waste, and you didn't even realize it! Even if you didn't touch anything at all with the glove, it's a good habit to always use the one glove policy.</p>
            <p><b>No Gloves in the Breakroom: </b>No gloves in the breakroom or on the breakroom door! We eat in the breakroom so this is hard rule. Not even one, not just to grab something really quickly, definitely not in the break room trash can.</p>
            <p><b>Reusing Gloves: </b>General practice is to not reuse gloves that have become wet, they're also like the least expensive things in lab so if in doubt change them out!</p>
